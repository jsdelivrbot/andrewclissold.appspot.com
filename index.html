    I’m a magician.
    <br>
    <br>
    I’m in the business of creating something out of nothing—software engineering—and believe that concepts such as languages, variables, objects,
    algorithms, and design patterns are gorgeous. I also avidly devour new technology and ideas as they become available and am always awaiting
    the next big thing.
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks for stopping by.
