<h2>Music Permutations</h2>
<p>
  Placeholder content. This is a reminder to myself that I want to talk about
  permutations of varying-length elements and how to randomly select them (in terms of
  music: how to build a measure consisting of random rhythms).
</p>
<p>
  That is, how to generate a random permutation of n discrete objects of different values with repetition allowed and whose values must add up to a sum m.
